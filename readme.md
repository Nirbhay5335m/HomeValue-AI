# 🏠 House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Overview
This project predicts house prices based on property features such as area, number of bedrooms, location-related attributes, and furnishing status.  
The system uses machine learning models and provides a web-based interface using Streamlit.

## 📂 Dataset
- Source: Housing.csv
- Features include area, bedrooms, bathrooms, stories, parking, and categorical attributes
- Target variable: Price

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Streamlit

## ⚙️ Workflow
1. Data loading & preprocessing
2. Encoding categorical variables
3. Model training (Linear Regression, Random Forest)
4. Model evaluation using R² and RMSE
5. Best model selection
6. Model saving using joblib
7. Frontend integration using Streamlit

## 📈 Model Performance
- Linear Regression: Baseline model
- Random Forest Regressor: Selected as final model based on performance
